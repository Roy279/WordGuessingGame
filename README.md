```
This is what is in the index.html file.This mainly builds up the basis & components of our game.We have the title of the Game in an h1.Then a div with the class content is made to house our content for the game. In content we have:
```
-A Div tag with class "inputs".This will show the text of our guessing to find the answer with the given hint.
-A Div tag with class "details". This will house the hint,guess left and wrong letters for the user to see.  
-The div tag has 3 p tags,one with the class "hint",second,with class "time" and third,with the class "wrong-letter".All of them will display the hint,guess left and wrong letters for the user respectively.   
-Input tag for the input field for the users answer  
-Another div tag with a button tag with class "reset-btn", will reset the current question to another for the user has to guess.  
```
There are 3 things linked inside the html file. we have:
```
1. A link for the CSS File style.css  
2. A script link for words.js file  
3. A script link for the script.js file   
```
## We will start with style.css:

The CSS File contains basically all the code we need to format how the game will look.Each element we gave it certain properties to make it the way it looks.

## words.js file:
```js 
let wordList = [
    {
        word: "python",

]
```
This code basiaclly is the list of words & their hints.The said words are the words the user will try & guess.  

## Script.js file:

This file contains all the functionality of the game and it is very important.

in the file:
We have to declare the constant variables we need to make the game run.

```js
const inputs = document.querySelector(".inputs"),
hintTag = document.querySelector(".hint span"),
guessLeft = document.querySelector(".guess-left span"),
wrongLetter = document.querySelector(".wrong-letter span"),
resetBtn = document.querySelector(".reset-btn"),
typingInput = document.querySelector(".typing-input");

```
after declaring the previous variables that are constant we declare ones that arent

```js
let word, maxGuesses, incorrectLetters = [], correctLetters = [];
```
## The first function
## randomWord:
randomWord function written like this:
```js
function randomWord() {
    let ranItem = wordList[Math.floor(Math.random() * wordList.length)];
    word = ranItem.word;
    maxGuesses = word.length >= 5 ? 8 : 6;
    correctLetters = []; incorrectLetters = [];
    hintTag.innerText = ranItem.hint;
    guessLeft.innerText = maxGuesses;
    wrongLetter.innerText = incorrectLetters;

    let html = "";
    for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
        html += `<input type="text" disabled>`;
        inputs.innerHTML = html;
    }
}
```
```
-In the code above, ranItem is there to choose a random word inside the word.js for the user to answer. 
-maxGuesses is there to limit the max guessing availability to the user to answer the given word.
-hintTag.innertext is for show the hint text from the variable of ranItem.hint.
-guessLeft.innertext is for show the available guessing limit.
-wrongLetter.innertext is for show the wrong letters that have been guess by the user.
```

```js
randomWord()
```
After we create the function and want to see the functionality of the function,We just simply call the function like shown above.
## The second function
## initGame:
initGame function written like this:
